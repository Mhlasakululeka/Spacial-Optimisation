# Spacial-Optimisation Problem

Formally, the problem asks to find the optimal time (minimum time) route between different locations in KwaZulu Natal.The locations are as folllow:
1. 115 St Andrews Drive, Durban North, KwaZulu Natal, South Africa
2. 67 Boshoff Street, Pietermaritzburg, KwaZulu Natal, South Africa
3. 4 Pual Avenue, Fairview, Empangeni, KwaZulu Natal, South Africa
4. 166 Kerk Street, Vryheil, KwaZulu Natal, South Africa
5. 9 Margaret Street, Ixopo, KwaZulu Natal, South Africa
6. 16 Poort Road, Ladysmith, Durban North, KwaZulu Natal, South Africa

Informally, you have a delivery driver who wants to visit a number of delivery address locations and wants to find the shortest path to visit all the locations.

An exhaustive search of all possible paths would be guaranteed to find the shortest, but is computationally intractable for all but small sets of locations. For larger problems, optimization techniques are needed to intelligently search the solution space and find near-optimal solutions.
