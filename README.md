Formally, the problem asks to find the minimum distance cycle in a set of nodes in 2D space. Informally, you have a salesman who wants to visit a number of cities and wants to find the shortest path to visit all the cities. This NP-hard problem has no efficient algorithm to find the optimal solution (for now...).
