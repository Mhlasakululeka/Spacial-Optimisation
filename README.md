# Spacial-Optimisation Problem

Formally, the problem asks to find the optimal time (minimum time) route between different locations in KwaZulu Natal.The location s are as folllow:
1. 115 St Andrews Drive, Durban North, KwaZulu Natal
2. 67 Boshoff Street, Pietermaritzburg, KwaZulu Natal
3. 4 Pual Avenue, Fairview, Empangeni, KwaZulu Natal
4. 166 Kerk Street, Vryheil, KwaZulu Natal
5. 9 Margaret Street, Ixopo, KwaZulu Natal


Informally, you have a salesman who wants to visit a number of cities and wants to find the shortest path to visit all the cities. This NP-hard problem has no efficient algorithm to find the optimal solution (for now...).
